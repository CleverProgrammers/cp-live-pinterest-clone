Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence.

If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations.

Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\n\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the primary client object store.\n */\n\n\nfunction Hi(t) {\n  return Kr(t, Or.store);\n}\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the client metadata object store.\n */\n\n\nfunction Ki(t) {\n  return Kr(t, Gr.store);\n}\n/**\n * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\n * LocalStorage.\n */\n\n\nfunction Xi(t, e) {\n  // Use two different prefix formats:\n  //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\n  //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\n  // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\n  // so there's no danger of collisions.\n  var n = t.projectId;\n  return t.o || (n += \".\" + t.database), \"firestore/\" + e + \"/\" + n + \"/\"\n  /**\n  * @license\n  * Copyright 2020 Google LLC\n  *\n  * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n  * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n  * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n  *\n  *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n  *\n  * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n  * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n  * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n  * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n  * limitations under the License.\n  */\n  ;\n}\n\nvar Wi = function (t, e) {\n  this.progress = t, this.Go = e;\n},\n    Zi =\n/** @class */\nfunction () {\n  function t(t, e, n) {\n    this.fo = t, this.zo = e, this.Ei = n\n    /**\n    * Get the local view of the document identified by `key`.\n    *\n    * @returns Local view of the document or null if we don't have any cached\n    * state for it.\n    */\n    ;\n  }\n\n  return t.prototype.Ho = function (t, e) {\n    var n = this;\n    return this.zo.bi(t, e).next(function (r) {\n      return n.Jo(t, e, r);\n    });\n  },\n  /** Internal version of `getDocument` that allows reusing batches. */\n  t.prototype.Jo = function (t, e, n) {\n    return this.fo._i(t, e).next(function (t) {\n      for (var r = 0, i = n; r < i.length; r++) {\n        t = i[r].Cs(e, t);\n      }\n\n      return t;\n    });\n  }, // Returns the view of the given `docs` as they would appear after applying\n  // all mutations in the given `batches`.\n  t.prototype.Yo = function (t, e, n) {\n    var r = fn();\n    return e.forEach(function (t, e) {\n      for (var i = 0, o = n; i < o.length; i++) {\n        e = o[i].Cs(t, e);\n      }\n\n      r = r.zt(t, e);\n    }), r;\n  },\n  /**\n   * Gets the local view of the documents identified by `keys`.\n   *\n   * If we don't have cached state for a document in `keys`, a NoDocument will\n   * be stored for that key in the resulting set.\n   */\n  t.prototype.Xo = function (t, e) {\n    var n = this;\n    return this.fo.getEntries(t, e).next(function (e) {\n      return n.Zo(t, e);\n    });\n  },\n  /**\n   * Similar to `getDocuments`, but creates the local view from the given\n   * `baseDocs` without retrieving documents from the local store.\n   */\n  t.prototype.Zo = function (t, e) {\n    var n = this;\n    return this.zo.vi(t, e).next(function (r) {\n      var i = n.Yo(t, e, r),\n          o = hn();\n      return i.forEach(function (t, e) {\n        // TODO(http://b/32275378): Don't conflate missing / deleted.\n        e || (e = new Vt(t, X.min())), o = o.zt(t, e);\n      }), o;\n    });\n  },\n  /**\n   * Performs a query against the local view of all documents.\n   *\n   * @param transaction - The persistence transaction.\n   * @param query - The query to match documents against.\n   * @param sinceReadTime - If not set to SnapshotVersion.min(), return only\n   *     documents that have been read since this snapshot version (exclusive).\n   */\n  t.prototype.Kr = function (t, e, n) {\n    /**\n    * Returns whether the query matches a single document by path (rather than a\n    * collection).\n    */\n    return function (t) {\n      return tt.wt(t.path) && null === t.collectionGroup && 0 === t.filters.length;\n    }(e) ?

Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”.

Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API.
